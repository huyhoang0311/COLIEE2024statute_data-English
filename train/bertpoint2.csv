"
In a case where A manifests his intention to sell land X owned by A to B while knowing that such manifestation of intention does not reflect A's true intention, even if A's manifestation of intention is void because B could have known that A's manifestation of intention was not true, if C in good faith purchases land X from B, A may not assert against C the nullity of such manifestation of intention.

Assume that A holds a first ranked mortgage on Land X and Land Y as a joint mortgage to secure claim α held by A against B. Land X and Land Y are owned by B. In this case, if A's mortgage over both lands is executed and the proceeds are to be distributed simultaneously, the burden of claim α is divided in proportion to the value of each land, even if there is no subordinated mortgagee.

Assume that A holds a first ranked mortgage on Land X and Land Y as a joint mortgage to secure claim α held by A against B. Land X is owned by B, Land Y is owned by C, and D is the second ranked mortgagee on Land X. In this case, if A executes a mortgage on Land Y only and receives the payment of the entire claim α out of the proceeds, C may exercise A's mortgage on Land X in subrogation to A.

Assume that A has a claim against B for 20 million yen based on a contract for sale with B and that B is insolvent and knew that each act would prejudice the creditor. B had assigned its claim against E to F prior to the conclusion of the contract for sale with A, but the notice to E using an instrument bearing a certified date on the assignment was given after A's claim against B had arisen.

Assume that the quality of movable X, which was delivered from the seller B to the buyer A based on a contract for sale, does not conform to the terms of the contract. If A's demand that B cure the non-conformity of performance is precluded because the non-conformity is impossible to cure, A may not demand that B reduce the price.

Assume that the quality of movable X delivered from the seller B to the buyer A based on a contract for sale does not conform to the terms of the contract. If B did not know of the non-conformity without negligence at the time of delivery and A failed to notify B of the non-conformity within the statutory period from the time when A became aware of it, then A may not demand B to compensate for damages.
